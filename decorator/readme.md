Welcome to Starbuzz Coffee
Starbuzz coffee has made a name for itself as the fastest growing coffee shop around.
If you've seen one on your local corner, look across the street; you'll see another one.

Because they've grown so quickly, they are scrambling to update their ordering systems to match their beverage offerings.
When they first went into business they designed their classes like this.



In addition to you coffee, you can also ask for serveral conditments like steamed milk, soy, mocha and have it all topped off with whipped milk. Starbuzz charges a bit for each of these, so they really need to get them built into their order system.
